KNOWN BUGS:
	- Pieces can sometimes perform take moves when they shouldnt be able to
		use Position.IsTakeMove then test jumped over square to see if not null

TODO:
	- When the AI makes moves, it is sometimes hard to see what/where a move has been made - Animations?

	- Prune the tree

	- Make end game more agressive

	- Something for small changes in difficulty

	- Improve board redraws so we dont update the entire board every time
