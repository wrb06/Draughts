BUGS:
	- Kingpiece didnt take

	- restart game button doesnt disappear when new game is loaded

TODO:
	- When the AI makes moves, it is sometimes hard to see what/where a move has been made - Animations?

	- Prune the tree

	- Make end game more agressive

	- Something for small changes in difficulty

	- Move GUI rendering and move rendering to different threads
